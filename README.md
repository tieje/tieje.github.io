This site serves as my current professional blog site. I realized that the scope of my previous site, [portfolio-blog-fresh](https://github.com/tieje/portfolio-blog-fresh), was too big. Updating the blog portion of [portfolio-blog-fresh](https://github.com/tieje/portfolio-blog-fresh) was a pain, so instead, I decided to create a new blog site using a static site generator called Zola. [portfolio-blog-fresh](https://github.com/tieje/portfolio-blog-fresh) will serve simply as my portfolio site.
