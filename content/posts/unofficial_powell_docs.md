&emsp; Powell 365 is an easier way to build SharePoint sites with web parts than with the tools natively available on SharePoint. The documentation of Powell is poor. This [project](https://github.com/tieje/unofficial_powell_365_docs) is an opportunity to build and showcase my skills in writing documentation.
