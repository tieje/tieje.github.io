- pick a book to read about making clean code and programming architecture
  - I chose The Pragmatic Programmer because it's the most recommended programming book
- choose a rust crate library to study to get better at writing good rust code
  - I'll probably just choose tauri because it's related to what I'm doing
- work on coding problems from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

[Codewar solution](https://www.codewars.com/kata/577a98a6ae28071780000989/solutions)
```rust
fn minimum(arr: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    *arr.iter().min().unwrap()
}

fn maximum(arr: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    *arr.iter().max().unwrap()
}
```
Learn about the following:
- [unwrap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html?highlight=unwrap()#shortcuts-for-panic-on-error-unwrap-and-expect)
- learn about [iterators](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-02-iterators.html?highlight=iter()#methods-that-produce-other-iterators)


- work on a codewar problem


- get active in the rust community and see which libraries need contributors
- create a post about figuring out what you want to do with rust
- fix disqus
