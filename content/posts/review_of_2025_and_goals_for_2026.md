## How I did on my goals for 2025

- [x] Continue learning and using Rust for projects.
    - This happened a little bit. I wrote Rust for a simple server project for learning about how servers work, but that's about it.
- [ ] Setup my Raspberry PIs as my personal servers.
    - I got them setup, but ... I didn't do anything with them.
- [ ] Check out Deno, again. Can it finally replace NodeJS?
    - Yes, Deno is ready. No, I didn't do anything with Deno yet, sadly.
- [ ] Get better at fundamentals like networking. I've never really learned OSI layers in depth.
    - I understand the OSI layers better from the server project. I guess one doesn't really "learn" the OSI layers because there is just so much protocol involved.
- [ ] Get better at C#. This is for work.
    - Totally did not happen. I feel like my C# skills are about the same as when I started.
- [ ] Really learn how Nginx works. It keeps popping up in my life.
    - I understand Nginx better due to needing to work with it, but I still don't really understand Nginx.
- [ ] Get better at Linux. I use Arch, btw.
    - I did get slightly better at Linux. I actually trashed my original Arch setup to install Windows OS strictly for League of Legends. And then somehow near the end of the year on my break, I figured out how to dual boot Arch linux and now I'm back to learning and using Arch (btw).

### Physical

- [ ] Lose 20 lbs.
    - Not even close. But I'm actually not sure how much I weigh right now.
- [ ] Be able to do 20 pull ups.
    - Not even close. Working out was so on and off. I really need a schedule.
- [ ] Workout something every day.
    - What a terrible goal.

### Mental

- [ ] Try to write every day.
    - On and off. Not consistent at all.
- [ ] Get better at writing.
    - I didn't have the will-power nor the reason to get much better at writing.
- [ ] Have more organized thoughts.
    - Also, a terrible goal. How do I measure this?

## Goals for 2026

Less is more.

### Physical 2026

- [ ] Fit those pair of pants that I know that I could fit if I just lost a few pounds.
- [ ] Prioritize morning workouts. I need to wake up sooner, like 6:30 - 7am. I don't even need to workout a lot. Short workouts several times a day are actually better than a single workout session. I will do a mini workout every two hours. I should set a timer.

### Mental 2026

I'm pretty happy where I am right now. I'm trying to use my phone less, which should have some kind of dramatic change in lifestyle.

## Career 2026

The thesis of this year is to get so good at my job, that I am mentally free to pursue other things without the guilt. I love my job. I want to protect my workplace. But, honestly, I don't feel like I am very good at it. This is the year I really start mastering everything so I can become blazingly fast.

- [ ] Get good a Neovim. I use AI at work, but honestly, it's just buying me time until I can get blazingly fast with Neovim.
- [ ] Get good at C#. I love Rust, I really want to code more in it. But I must recognize that I can't go forward with Rust if I haven't mastered the work that pays the bills.
- [ ] Get good at JavaScript/TypeScript/React/Frontend stuff. Same as above, I just need to good at my so I can spend my time focusing on other things.
- [ ] Get amazing at debugging for C# and React using Neovim/Linux tools.
- [ ] Get at least one Microsoft Azure certificate. Certificates don't really matter much, but I feel like it's probably one of the more concrete things I can do to learn Azure cloud.
