I am not a good writer. I have studied well in school. I get asked by family to correct their speeches and format some important messages. But I don't consider myself to be very good at writing. I think some of it is writer's block. Another part is that I don't think my ideas are very well organized. In the end, it doesn't matter, no one is going to read it, the sun is going to explode in 60 billion years...

But what if I *am* a good writer? What if I am a **great** writer? Well I would never know unless I tried. What even is a great writer anyways? Clearly, it's not someone who can back up every single sentence under rigorous scrutiny because otherwise scientists would be the G.O.A.T. at writing. It's gotta be someone who makes a stirring in your heart, someone who changes the way you think. It's a song for the mind. Vines and flutters, creeks and forests.

Write because you can. Write because it is meaningful. And because it is meaningful to *you*.
