## TODO

- [ ] install Ansible locally
- [ ] install Ansible Linter locally
- [ ] install Docker using Ansible
- [ ] install Docker Swarm using Ansible
- [ ] Create a simple test app to serve on your home network.
- [ ] Host the test app on your Docker Swarm
- [ ] Create a second test app to serve on your home network.
- [ ] Host the second test app on your Docker Swarm
- [ ] Use Traefik to dynamically point to both test apps.
- [ ] Increase file descriptors that Docker has access to just in case. Well see if Docker is reliant on file descriptors for creating connections first. It may not be like Nginx.
